# Volcano-Map

Here's the GitHub Pages link: https://bradyfish.github.io/Volcano-Map/

This is a map of all the volcanoes from the database here: http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/volcano_table

I created this map using folium as part of this Python course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/learn/v4/overview

Thanks!
